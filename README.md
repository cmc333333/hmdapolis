# HMDApolis [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/cfpb/hmdapolis.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/cfpb/hmdapolis)

HMDApolis (pronounced *hum-dapolis*) is a two-player turn-based strategy game utilizing live [HMDA data](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/hmda/). It was created by [@cmc333333](https://github.com/cmc333333), [@contolini](https://github.com/contolini) and [@himedlooff](https://github.com/himedlooff) during a February 2013 weekend hackathon at the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/). Art is by [@duelj](https://github.com/duelj).

## How to play

Head over to http://cfpb.github.io/hmdapolis. A board will be randomly generated on page load.

At the start of each turn, a profile is randomly generated for the current player and is shown on the left side of the screen. The profile consists of a year, income and regulatory agency. The current player clicks a mortgage (dollar amount in a hex title) that they think will be approved given the details of their profile and the city adjacent to the clicked mortgage. [CFPB's HMDA API](https://api.consumerfinance.gov/data/hmda/slice/hmda_lar) is queried to determine the likelihood of the mortgage being approved. If at least 51% of similar real-world mortgages were approved, the player wins that tile. Otherwise, the tile is lost. Play continues to Player #2.

The game ends after all tiles have been won or lost. The player who has "captured" the most cities by having the most won tiles touching it wins the game.
